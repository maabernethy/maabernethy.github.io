          My vision of the world at the beginning of college was that interests were split into categories, much like subjects
          in high school. My favorite classes were Math and Art. In my naivety, I believed these were antithetical interests,
          and to be successful I must select one as my career, and the other as just a hobby. How could I have been so wrong!
          Development is really the act of bringing design to life. Technology is where problem-solving meets artistry (Or, Math
          meets Art, for young Marin). One informs the other, cyclically. As cliche as it sounds, technology is powerful - from
          improving productivity to bridging educational and social gaps - the possibilities are endless; and that fascinates me.

          I have lived in four countries and visited about 20 more. In this increasingly globalized world, traveling has proved to
          be essential to my professional and personal growth. Interacting with people with different backgrounds in foreign places
          has undoubtedly made me a better listener, planner, and communicator with more compassion, and adeptness at relating to
          others. Getting my masters degree at the University of Auckland, NZ not only allowed me to explore different facets of
          my industry, it gave me the opportunity to learn more about my family history (I have NZ citizenship through my father).
          After completing the degree, I took 6 months to navigate through 10 countries -

          Art keeps me grounded and balanced. Design gives meaning to development. My Studio Arts minor in college was born out of a
          constant need for a hands-on, creative outlet. Similarly, my Masters was rounded off with HCI/UX courses to counterbalance
          more technical ones. In my free time, I am usually working on some art or craft project - drawing, painting, sculpting,
          sewing, etc. The majority of my artistic pursuits turn into personal gifts for others,
          <a target="_blank" href="https://flic.kr/s/aHsmoRdXtx"> but here is a sampling of some that didn't</a>. I like to think my
          eye for design is more than just a hobby, and moreover, that it enables me to bridge the communication gap between technical
          and creative teams in a work environment.
