  title="GoalKeeper: an Accountability service"
  link="https://www.facebook.com/GetGoalkeeper/"
  description="My current side project (*working title*)! GoalKeeper enables you to invest in your
  ambitions. You must bet on your goals, and get your friends to do the same.
  Whoever reaches the goal, shares the pot. The current implementation is a
  proof of concept, focusing on fitness goals. It is a web app built with the
  MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. It enables one to invest
  in their ambitions,"

  title="ParallelAR: An augmented reality app and instructional approach
  for learning parallel programming scheduling concepts"
  link=" http://parallel.auckland.ac.nz/education/parallelar/index.html"
  link2="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8425430/"
  description="Students tend to struggle with turning the abstract, higher level
  concepts of parallel programming into concrete mental models. Analogies
  are known to aid in this knowledge transfer, by providing an existing schema as the
  basis for the formation of a new schema. Combining these ideas, this paper presents a
  set of collaborative learning activities to target fundamental scheduling concepts, a
  detailed analogy to assist in the understanding of the scheduling concepts, and an
  augmented reality application to facilitate the collaborative learning
  activity by bringing the analogy to life."

  title="Signal to Emotion: An Experiment on Player Experience
  Evaluation with a Consumer-grade EEG Device"
  link="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3156160"
  description="In this study, we explored the potential
  of a consumer-grade EEG device in player experience evaluation compared to
  the questionnaire approach. Results show that the device provides
  somewhat matching data with the questionnaire and potentially further
  information about the momentary player experience. The study is based
  on play sessions during which brainwave data is recorded with a
  consumer-grade BCI device that passively monitors the brainwaves.
  Questionnaires are used as a basis for analysis while session
  observations are used as supportive components for qualitative
  analysis."

  title="Enhanced Error Messages"
  link="https://github.com/maabernethy/improved-error-messages"
  description="Compiler error messages are known to be cryptic and
  misleading, and thus produce a barrier to real feedback for novice
  programmers. To aid in the challenges of debugging, I developed
  a web tool to enhance the experience of novice programmers by
  improving compiler error messages and how they are presented to the
  user. This web app is built using Ember.js and relied heavily on the
  ivy-codemirror add-on."
